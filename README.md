# iot-cat
Use an IoT-enabled device to let your cat send you an email.

At present this is meant for use with an AWS IoT Button (like those Dash Buttons you can find on the Amazon.com website), and is not dynamic - it just sends a pre-written email to a pre-defined email address. But it's so easy to use, even your cat can use it!
